This organization is a collection and documentation of my homelab setup. The purpose of this homelab is to
experiment and tinker with various technologies, applications, and systems in a controlled environment,
while also providing a platform for hosting personal projects and services.

> Homelab is the name given to a server (or multiple server setup) that resides locally in your home
